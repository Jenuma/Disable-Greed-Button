    <description>--==Description==--

This mod disables and disarms the arena Greed button in Greed mode that starts and stops the waves until the room is clear.

This effectively means once you press the button, you have to complete all 8/9 waves (or both boss waves) uninterrupted, but the button will no longer harm you if you accidentally step on it while fighting.

Works for both Greed and Greedier modes. The Lost will also not incur a reward penalty for hovering over the button.

I made this because I've been playing a lot of Greedier mode lately and I got tired of getting hurt immediately after starting a wave, or trying to shoot past a room full of stonies while also kiting the spiked button. If you're the kind of player that never pauses in Greed mode, this is the mod for you.

--==Compatibility==--

This mod should work with any other mods that don't:
- Alter the state of the Greed button
- Add additional pressure plate entities to the Greed arena

It does not affect the behavior of any other pressure plates.

--==Known Issues==--

Exiting the game or force closing it in the middle of a wave can potentially cause the button to have undefined behavior when you try to continue the save, such as being unpressable. I don't really have plans to fix this since the whole point is not quitting the waves until they're over in the first place. Starting a new run will reset the button.</description>
