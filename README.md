# Disable-Greed-Button
Binding of Isaac: Afterbirth+ mod that disarms/disables the Greed button during the waves.
  
I made this out of frustration after I kept getting hit by the button almost immediately after starting a wave. It effectively prevents
you from being able to pause the wave, but is balanced by also not damaging you if you accidentally walk over it during a fight.
